# Risks

Due to the nature of how FiBo is developed, we are facing an enormous amount of risks - not only compared to peer teams, but also compared to professional environments.

## Factors

Notable factors of why we need to deal with many risks in pursueing the project are:

- big team size (five people)
- inexperience
- huge, sometimes unrecognized technical complexity in project

## Dealing with risks

By **keeping track** of them, **rating** their **probability** as well as their **impact**, we get the **total factor**.
We try to **mitigate** the risks preemptive by thinking about how to mitigate them.
Further, by **appointing a team member** in charge of managing the risk, they become clearer in our weekly status meetings.

## Risk table

| No. | Name of Risk | Description | Probabilty of Occurence (0-1) | Impact (0-10) | Total factor (Probability * Impact) | Mitigation | Person in Charge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Insufficient communication | With a team of five, there is a possibility of communication breakdown. This could lead to missed deadlines and errors in the project. | 0,75 | 6 | 4,5 | Awareness, clear communication in the open on our Discord server to keep history and allow others to step in | Jens
| 2 | Wrong time estimation | unable to reach intended goals | 0,75 |
| 3 | Misunderstandment of requirements |  | 0,3 | | | before putting a ticket into a sprint, it is talked about in the team. Acceptance criteria are added to make sure the key points are clear. The team is obligated to fulfill the acceptance criteria only. |
| 4 | Unknown complexity when creating tickets | The scope of the project may expand beyond what the team can handle, leading to delays and possible failure. |
| 5 | Technology failures | breaking changes in our tech stack requiring immediate changes |
| 6 | Code quality / Technical debts | resulting in delays |
| 7 | Hardware problems | lockout of hardware, technical failures | 0,2 | 9
| 8 | Team members get ill or don't pass exams |  |
| 9 | Mental overload |  |
| 10 | Lack of motivation |  |
| 11 | Conflicts in team |  |
| 12 | Other obligations due to study | exam preparation etc. |

## Summary

To mitigate these risks, the team should establish clear communication channels, define project goals and objectives, and plan the project in detail - while allowing things to change.
They should also identify and address technical issues early on and work collaboratively to resolve conflicts. Additionally, team members should be motivated and willing to learn new skills and techniques to ensure the project's success.
Personal growth and awareness to recognize one's strengths and weaknesses are important as well.
