# Risks

Due to the nature of how FiBo is developed, we are facing an enormous amount of risks - not only compared to peer teams, but also compared to professional environments.

## Factors

Notable factors of why we need to deal with many risks in pursueing the project are:

- big team size (five people)
- inexperience
- huge, sometimes unrecognized technical complexity in project

## Dealing with risks

By **keeping track** of them, **rating** their **probability** as well as their **impact**, we get the **total factor**.
We try to **mitigate** the risks preemptive by thinking about how to mitigate them.
Further, by **appointing a team member** in charge of managing the risk, they become clearer in our weekly status meetings.

## Risk table

| No. | Name of Risk | Description | Probabilty of Occurence (0-1) | Impact (0-10) | Total factor (Probability * Impact) | Mitigation | Person in Charge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Insufficient communication | With a team of five, there is a possibility of communication breakdown. This could lead to missed deadlines and errors in the project. | 0,75 | 6 | 4,5 | To mitigate the risk, there are multiple levers to pull: (a) Awareness for this risk, (b) assigning roles and responsibilites, (c) use the Discord server to document everything and allow others to step in, (c) being open for feedback | Jens |
| 2 | Wrong time estimations | Accurately estimating the time required to complete a project is a critical aspect of project management. If the team underestimates the time required, they may not have enough time to complete the project, leading to delays and missed deadlines. | 0,75 | 5 | 3,75 | To mitigte this risk, the team draws attention to the past estimations. The tickets to estimate are broken down into smaller, more manageable and clearer tasks. They were prepared and prioritized for refinement (estimating) by the project manager. The project manager makes sure that there are no blockers or issues in sight when giving the team the task to implement. | Jens |
| 3 | Misunderstandment of requirements | Requirements are the foundation of any project, and if they are misunderstood, it can result in a project that does not meet the intended goals and objectives. This can lead to wasted time, effort, and resources, as well as frustration among team members and the customer (Kay). | 0,3 | 5 | 1,5 | Before a ticket is put into a sprint, it is talked about in the team. Acceptance criteria are discussed to make sure the key points are clear to everyone. The team is obligated to fulfill the acceptance criteria only. | Jens, Markus, Jonas, Chris, Lars |
| 4 | Unknown complexity when creating tickets | The scope of the project may expand beyond what the team can handle, leading to delays and possible failure. | 0,2 | 7 | 1,4 | To mitigate this risk, tickets are prioritized and broken down into smaller parts. Regular reviews deepens the understanding on complexity and technical ways to implement the features, helping the project manager to get a feeling for the involved complexity for a new ticket. | Jens |
| 5 | Technology failures | This may include breaking changes in our tech stack requiring immediate changes, as well as unexpected behavior of technology, ultimately leading to the result that the goal of the project is not achievable. | 0,1 | 10 | 1 | This risk can be best mitigated by two strategies: (a) choosing reliable technology with a record of stability as well as reliability (following best practices), (b) training team member to employ them with the power to response to technology failure immediately on their own behalf | Jonas |
| 6 | Code quality / Technical debts | Technical debt refers to the shortcuts or compromises taken in the development process that can lead to problems down the road. This can include poorly written code, incomplete documentation, lack of testing, or outdated technology stacks. | 0,2 | 3 | 0,6 | This risk can be mitigated by establishing coding standards and best practices. By conducting code reviews, focus is taken on the possibility for further extension and growth. The team is reminded of the wish for refactoring whenever helpful, to adress technical debts early on and get rid of those. Tests can be used as a measure of confidence, so refactoring can be done easier because the behavior is tested. This includes unit tests, integration tests as well as regression tests. The team is aware that taking shortcuts is not wanted and will hinder us down the path when it'll become the most stressful. | Markus |
| 7 | Hardware problems | Hardware may fail or malfunction for any reason, including theft. Firmware or human failures may result in a lock-out of our developers so that the hardware becomes unusable for our project. | 0,2 | 9 | 1,8 | This risk can be mitigated by regular maintenance and testing. By making sure all important work is pushed to GitHub, we have another layer of security in case someone looses access to their laptop. | Jens |
| 8 | Team members get ill or don't pass exams | At this big complexity in our project, we are in demand of working capacity. If fellow students (team members) are not able to work because they are no longer part of the university due to failing exams or getting ill for a longer period of time, the project may not reach its objectives. | 0,2 | 10 | 2 | This risk is hard to mitigate. All of us need to make sure to pass exams and pay attention to both physical and mental health. Further, cross-training of team members should remain a focus to make sure we don't get into knowledge silos. We are providing additional support, for example tutoring und mentoring not only for this project but overall to make sure everyone stays with us. Planning for team member absences, if necessary, helps as well. | Chris |
| 9 | Mental overload | Mental overload can occur when team members are faced with a high degree of technical complexity in a project. Technical complexity refers to the level of difficulty in understanding and working with the technology or systems involved in the project. When technical complexity is high, team members may struggle to understand the requirements, design, or implementation of the project, leading to mental overload. For example, this could result in burnout or exhaustion by feeling out of control. | 0,3 | 7 | 2,1 | It is very important that every one of us receives adequate training. For example, tickets may include links to learning materials. The project manager takes care for every team member by encouraging to take regular breaks and time off to prevent stress and reduce burnout. Good project management makes sure timelines and expectations are realistic. | Jens |
| 10 | Lack of motivation | Lack of motivation could result in destructive behavior, which may ultimately lead to project failure | 0,2 | 10 | 2 | Embracing to communicate openly is a significant part to tackle this. Celebrating successes, making sure clear goals and exectations are provided helps reduce the risk. | Chris |
| 11 | Conflicts in team | For example, technical discussions in reviews could get heated which may result in personal conflicts | 0,2 | 10 | 2 | It is important to spread the awareness to make sure conflicts aren't heating up because everyone is aware of the high risk it imposes. By building a team cohesion as well as to remind everyone to stay calm and don't take things personally, we build an athomsphere where everyone gets the impression that everyone did the best possible. | Markus |
| 12 | Other obligations due to study | Examples could be: exam preparation, finishing other projects, lack of shared time due to conflicts in schedules because of other team meetings etc. | 0,9 | 5 | 4,5 | By planning ahead while staying flexible, communicating regularly as well as to prioritize tasks, we make sure this hinders us as little as possible. | Lars |

## Summary

To mitigate these risks, the team should establish clear communication channels, define project goals and objectives, and plan the project in detail - while allowing things to change.
They should also identify and address technical issues early on and work collaboratively to resolve conflicts. Additionally, team members should be motivated and willing to learn new skills and techniques to ensure the project's success.
Personal growth and awareness to recognize one's strengths and weaknesses are important as well.
