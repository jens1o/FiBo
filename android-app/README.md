# FiBo Android app

## Setting up development environment

Please set the following to the `gradle.properties` (Project Properties) file:

```ini
jwsSigningKey="<replace me with your SIGNING_KEY>"
```

to the same key that's set in your `backend/.env` `SIGNING_KEY`. Instructions how to generate it can
be found in the backend/ documentation.
